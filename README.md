## Background

October has started and American Horror Story is back on TV. They use distinticitve Willow font created by Rennie Mackintosh (I guess, less so in this season). I have decided to make a map that is inspired by Mackintosh art. 

Roses indicate where some of the Mackintosh creations are located around Glasgow.

## Examples
There are some small scale examples:
