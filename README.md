## Willow-Mackintosh-Map
###### Rennie Mackintosh inspired map of Glasgow

## Background

###### October has started and ![American Horror Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Horror_Story) is back on TV. They use distinticitve Willow font created by Rennie Mackintosh (I guess, less so in this season). I have decided to make a map that is inspired by Mackintosh art. 

###### Roses indicate where some of the Mackintosh creations are located around Glasgow.
